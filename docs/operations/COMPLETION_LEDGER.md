# FRANCIS - COMPLETION_LEDGER

Shipped-state ledger for the current repository posture, hardening progress, and
productization gaps.

This file is intentionally narrower than `docs/canonical/ROADMAP.md`. The roadmap
defines the target state. This ledger records what is materially true in the repo,
using direct inspection plus validation that was actually run.

## 1. Document contract

Use this file for:

- current build posture
- high-confidence validated surfaces
- known gaps that still block a truthful "finished" claim
- the latest targeted validation evidence
- the first continuity/orientation source for recurring build automations

Do not use this file for:

- aspirational future capabilities
- unverified completion claims
- UI/demo descriptions that outrun server truth
- casual rewrites of canonical roadmap direction

Automation rule:

- recurring build automations should read this ledger first before re-reading the
  full canonical roadmap set
- canonical roadmap docs should be re-read when this ledger is missing, stale,
  contradicted by repo truth, or when milestone/workstream closure is being
  evaluated
- update this ledger at the end of a run when a validated surface materially
  changed, a major blocker was removed, or the strongest truthful build posture
  changed
- update `docs/canonical/BUILD_MANIFEST.md` or other canonical roadmap docs only
  when their own update contracts are actually met

## 2. Current build phase

Francis is in `Phase 2` per `docs/canonical/BUILD_MANIFEST.md`.

The strongest current posture is still the governed runtime spine, not the finished
operator product surface:

- `P9_OBSERVABILITY`: strongest plane today
- `P3_GOVERNANCE`: materially real
- `P1_INTERFACE`: partial
- `P7_EXECUTION`: partial
- `P8_MEMORY`: partial

This matches the current canonical build priority in `docs/BUILD_ORDER.md`:

1. close remaining governance and identity gaps
2. complete the end-to-end plan -> gate -> execute -> trace -> memory loop
3. expose that loop clearly in the chat UI

## 3. High-confidence current slice

As of `2026-04-15`, the highest-confidence surface newly touched in the current
working tree is the governed operations/runtime extension for exact-action
`git.push` approvals plus canonical Francis environment alias resolution.

Directly inspected implementation truth:

- `src/francis/agent/git_push.py` now binds approval to the exact local repo root,
  remote URL, branch, and upstream intent, and refreshes approval requests when
  that payload changes after an approval was granted instead of reusing a stale
  approval receipt.
- `src/francis/agent/executor.py`, `src/francis/operations/runtime.py`, and
  `src/francis/api/routes/operations.py` expose the same capability through the
  governed operations loop without bypassing `P3_GOVERNANCE`.
- `tests/test_api_operations.py` now proves that changing the configured remote
  after approval does not silently push and instead forces a fresh exact-action
  approval before execution can continue.
- `src/francis/settings.py` and `src/francis/llm/client.py` now resolve canonical
  `FRANCIS_*` environment aliases for repo/runtime/Ollama configuration while
  preserving legacy env-name fallback.

The `2026-04-14` operator-critical Chat UI/API continuity bridge remains
materially true in the repo and is still part of the active `P1_INTERFACE`
continuity line:

Directly inspected implementation truth:

- `apps/chat_ui/src/settings/index.ts` now probes canonical and compatibility alias
  routes for world state, continuity ledger, continuity briefing, orb state,
  operator mode, effective config, config mutation, and feature-flag mutation.
- `apps/chat_ui/src/settings/index.ts` now parses `/continuity/ledger` as a typed
  receipt feed so the operator console can render recent local continuity records
  without inventing synthetic state.
- `apps/chat_ui/src/settings/index.ts` now preserves continuity briefing counts,
  recently completed items, and deadletter preview items even when the backend
  omits a headline or focus list, so sparse handoff payloads do not disappear in
  the operator UI.
- `apps/chat_ui/src/operations/index.ts` now exposes the existing
  `POST /operations/run-once` worker-cycle route as a typed client method so the UI
  can trigger one bounded queue advancement step without inventing a new contract.
- `apps/chat_ui/src/App.tsx` now renders the continuity-embedded `operator` and
  `orb` surfaces inside the ORB panel shift briefing so handoff truth remains
  visible even if dedicated status polling degrades.
- `apps/chat_ui/src/App.tsx` now renders the raw continuity ledger tail in the ORB
  panel so recent chat/daemon continuity receipts remain inspectable during
  return-to-work review.
- `apps/chat_ui/src/App.tsx` now surfaces an explicit worker-cycle control in the
  `Operations` panel, tied to the active operator environment and disabled while the
  control posture is `observe`.
- `src/francis/api/routes/system.py` exposes the corresponding system aliases for
  read and mutation paths.
- `src/francis/api/routes/continuity.py` exposes continuity briefing at
  `/continuity/briefing`, `/continuity/shift_briefing`, and
  `/continuity/shift-briefing`.
- `src/francis/api/routes/continuity.py` also exposes the raw continuity ledger at
  `/continuity/ledger`.
- `src/francis/api/routes/operations.py` exposes both `/operations/run-once` and
  `POST /operations/{operation_id}/run`.
- `docs/CHAT_UI.md` now defines the current compatibility contract for these
  operator-critical surfaces instead of leaving them implied.

## 4. Latest validation evidence

The following validations were run against the current working tree on
`2026-04-15`:

- `pytest tests/test_api_operations.py tests/test_llm_client.py tests/test_settings.py`
  Result: `15 passed in 6.71s`
- `git diff --check -- src/francis/agent/git_push.py src/francis/agent/executor.py src/francis/api/routes/operations.py src/francis/operations/runtime.py src/francis/llm/client.py src/francis/settings.py tests/test_api_operations.py tests/test_llm_client.py tests/test_settings.py`
  Result: `passed`

Those validations specifically cover:

- governed `git.push` capability registration through the operations runtime
- approval-bound local Git push execution
- approval refresh when the approved remote payload becomes stale before execution
- canonical `FRANCIS_*` settings alias resolution and Ollama client fallback order

Earlier validation evidence from `2026-04-14` remains relevant for the continuity
bridge slice:

- `pytest tests/test_api_continuity.py tests/test_api_contract_chat_ui.py tests/test_api_operations.py tests/test_api_system_settings.py -q`
  Result: `28 passed`
- `cd apps/chat_ui && npm test`
  Result: `8 passed`
- `cd apps/chat_ui && npm run build`
  Result: `passed`

Those validations specifically cover:

- continuity ledger route tail behavior
- continuity briefing alias parity
- system read alias parity
- system mutation alias parity
- operations run and worker-pump routes
- chat UI continuity ledger client parsing and bounded limit requests
- chat UI worker-cycle client control and existing operation-run control
- chat UI endpoint fallback order and defensive parsing
- sparse continuity briefing retention when handoff payloads omit headline/focus
- chat UI production build integrity after surfacing embedded continuity operator/orb state and raw continuity ledger receipts

## 5. Known truthful gaps

These remain true and should block any "finished" claim:

- the operator experience is not yet a complete ORB console in `P1_INTERFACE`
- the full plan -> gate -> execute -> trace -> memory loop is not yet clearly
  exposed end-to-end in the chat UI
- memory and continuity are materially present but still partial as operator-facing,
  retrieval-backed systems
- evidence, simulation, and federation remain downstream/gated work, not current
  product-ready surfaces

## 6. Update rule

Update this ledger only when at least one of the following is true:

- a validated surface materially changed
- a plane posture changed in a way that is now directly inspectable
- a major blocker was removed
- the latest evidence set changed and should replace stale validation claims
